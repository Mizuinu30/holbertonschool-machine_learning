README for Calculus Project
Project Title

Holberton School Machine Learning - Calculus
Introduction

This project is designed to test the understanding and application of calculus concepts such as series, derivatives, integrals, and partial derivatives within the context of machine learning. The tasks range from evaluating basic mathematical expressions to implementing Python functions that calculate derivatives and integrals.

Installation

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/holbertonschool-machine_learning.git
cd holbertonschool-machine_learning/math/calculus

Usage

Each directory within the repository corresponds to a particular calculus concept and contains Python scripts or text files as solutions to the task.

Multiple Choice Questions:

    Navigate to the task directory (e.g., cd math/calculus).
    Edit the answer_file to type the number of the correct answer.
    Ensure each file ends with a new line.

Python Scripts:

    Ensure Python 3.9 is installed on your system.
    Run Python scripts using:

    bash

    ./script_name.py

Features

    Evaluates series using summation and product notations.
    Calculates derivatives, including partial derivatives.
    Implements indefinite and definite integrals.
    Python functions for calculating polynomial derivatives and integrals.
    No external libraries are required, ensuring clean and lightweight code.

Dependencies

    Python 3.9
    Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
    pycodestyle (2.11.1)

Configuration

    Python scripts should begin with the shebang line: #!/usr/bin/env python3.
    All Python files must adhere to the pycodestyle (version 2.11.1).

Documentation

Every module, class, and function should have appropriate docstrings as per Python's documentation standards. Use the following commands to view documentation:

bash

python3 -c 'print(__import__("module_name").__doc__)'
python3 -c 'print(__import__("module_name").ClassName.__doc__)'
python3 -c 'print(__import__("module_name").function_name.__doc__)'

Examples

Task 0 - Sigma is for Sum:

Question: Calculate ∑i=25i∑i=25​i.

Answer:

bash

cd math/calculus
echo "3" > 0-sigma_is_for_sum

Task 9 - Our life is the sum total:

Python Function Implementation:

python

def summation_i_squared(n):
    """Calculate the sum of the squares of integers from 1 to n."""
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:
        return None
    return (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 6

# Example usage
print(summation_i_squared(5))  # Output: 55

Troubleshooting

    Ensure all scripts are executable: chmod +x script_name.py.
    Files must end with a new line; use echo -n if manually adding lines.
    If the pycodestyle checks fail, adjust the code format to comply with Python's PEP 8 standards.

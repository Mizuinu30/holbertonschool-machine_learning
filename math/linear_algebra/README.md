[text]Linear Algebra Project
Introduction

This project consists of a series of exercises aimed at exploring fundamental concepts in linear algebra with a focus on practical implementation in Python. The tasks range from basic array and matrix manipulations like slicing and transposing to more complex operations such as matrix multiplication and concatenation using both pure Python and the numpy library.

Installation

No installation is required beyond the standard Python distribution. For exercises involving numpy, ensure you have the numpy package installed:

sh

pip install numpy

Usage

Each exercise file is a standalone Python script. Execute a script from the terminal as follows:

sh

python exercise_name.py

Replace exercise_name.py with the name of the exercise you wish to run.

Dependencies

    Python 3.x
    numpy (for exercises involving numpy)

Examples

Please refer to the comments within each exercise script for examples on how to use the functions or perform the tasks.
Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with numpy, ensure it is correctly installed and up-to-date. For other problems, reviewing Python's basic syntax or the specific documentation for array and matrix operations in Python and numpy may be helpful.
